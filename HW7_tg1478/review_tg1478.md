![Tashay Green's plot](plot_tg1478.png)

I have a few critiques of this plot. The scale of the bars is a little overwhelming for me in that they overpower the rest of the visualization to the point where it seems they even go beyond the Y scale, for example, in the month of August. This would indicate in my view a very small data to ink ratio. Skinnier or smaller bars would have worked a bit better in this case or a larger Y scale. Secondly, the months in the visualization are ordered in alphabetical order. At first glance, one might make the mistake of thinking the months are ordered chronologically and therefore derive wrong conclusions. It would have benn nice to have an indicator that the months are ordered alphabetically. Other than that there is little to no ambiguity, distortion or distraction, which makes this a good plot.
