# PUI 2016 Midterm Exam

## Midterm Exam

For this assignment, I completed an in-class midterm exam that analyzed income and CitiBike data for New York City riders.

To do so, I completed the following: 
- Downloaded CitiBike ridership data
- Downloaded IRS income data
- Cleaned & merged the data sets
- Fit data with OLS regression & 2nd degree polynomial 
- Analyzed trends

## Midterm Solution

This file is the solution to the exam as provided by my professor. 

## Reflection

I made a crucial mistake during the line fitting portion of the exam which. At a point where I was to fit the Adjusted Gross Income for riders, I mistakenly fit the Income Per Capita.
