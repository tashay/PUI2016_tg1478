## Assignment 1: Spatial Analysis of CitiBike Data

For this assignment, we were tasked with performing spatial analysis on a CitiBike data set. 

The data was segmented by Summer (April to September) and Winter (October to March) months. The data segments show nearly identical patterns in terms of spatial distributions, though there was a slightly higher spatial autocorrelation during the winter months. For the winter months, the Moran's I value was 0.660 vs 0.645 for the summer months.
