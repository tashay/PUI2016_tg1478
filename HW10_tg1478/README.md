# PUI 2016 HW 10.

## Assignment 1: Spatial Analysis of Monthly CitiBike Data

For this assignment, Dr. Sina Kushak of DataKind provided a notebook outlining how he had performed spatial analysis on monthly CitiBike data. 

I did not make any edits to this notebook. 


## Assignment 2: Spatial Analysis of Seasonal CitiBike Data

For this assignment, we were tasked with performing spatial analysis on seasonal CitiBike data as provided in Dr. Kushak's template notebook. 

The data was segmented by Summer (April to September) and Winter (October to March) months. The data segments show nearly identical patterns in terms of spatial distributions, though there was a slightly higher spatial autocorrelation during the winter months. For the winter months, the Moran's I value was 0.660 vs 0.645 for the summer months.
