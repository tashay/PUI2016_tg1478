# PUI 2016 Final Exam

## Final Exam

For this assignment, I completed a take-home exam that analyzed the evolution of diversity and socioeconimic characteristics of NYC census tracts and zip codes over the years 2000 and 2010.

To do so, I completed the following: 
- Downloaded NYC Businesses data
- Downloaded NYC Zipcode data
- Downloaded NYC Census data
- Cleaned & merged the data sets
- Clustered the data
- Plotted the data
- Analyzed trends

## Exam Feedback

File (1) is a copy of my exam plus my professor's feedback.

## Reflection

If I had more time to complete the exam, I would have performed the Pearson's correlation as well as plotted the differences between year 2000 and 2010 in the chloropleth maps. When clustering, I would also whiten the data in future analysis.
