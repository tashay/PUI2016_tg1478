## Assignment 1: Compare tests for Goodness of Fit 
For this assignment I wanted to test whether the Gaussian model would be sensible for analyzing the age distribution of CitiBike riders. If not, I would test other models.

To do so, I completed the following tasks:
- Used 2 tests: KS, Anderson Darling, to determine whether Gaussian was sensible.
- Tested at the data at Normal and Exponential distribution.

Findings: The Gaussian model is not sensible for analyzing age distribution of CitiBike riders. 


## Assignment 2: Line fitting and data wrangling using gendered income 

To complete regression plotting, I worked collaboratively with Jordan Vani. 

For this assignment, I compared the income level of males and females by race. I plotted the income data and fit it with OSL and Spearman analytical regressions. 


## Assignment 3: Practice formulating Null Hypotheses

Formulated the Null hypothesis in words and formulae for 4 experiments.
