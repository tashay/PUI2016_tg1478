## Assignment 1: Geopandas Plotting 

For this assignment, I completed the following tasks:
- Get the census tract shape files from: http://www1.nyc.gov/ 
- Extract only the Brooklyn shape polygons and convert the coordinates to lat/lon
- Find the coordinates of CUSP: 1 MetroTech Brooklyn. Create a point with the coordinates of CUSP
- Find the geometry in which the polygon is contained

## Assignment 2: Clustering Time Trends for Businesses in NYC 
I consulted Geoff Perrin on this assignment. He assisted me with errors pertaining to reading in the data and removing infinit values.

For this assignment, I completed the following tasks:
- Get and prep NYC zipcode & NYC businesses data
- Cluster the # of establishments time series data with K-means 
- Plot the cluster centers 
- Use DBSCAN clustering algorithm
- Overlay data on a NYC map using the shapefile for the zip codes and different colors for different clusters
- Compare the results of the 2 algorithms
- Attempt an interpretation of the results.
