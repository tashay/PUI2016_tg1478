## Assignment 2: CitiBike Rider and Membership Investigation
This investigative analysis and Authorea write-up was done collaboratively with Jordan Vani. 

For this assignment, we wanted to explore whether more 24-Hour CitiBike passes were purchased during weekends or weekdays between April - June 2016. 

We obtained data from the CitiBike System Data portal, manipulated it using Pandas, and analyzed it by performing a _t-test_.
