# PUI 2016 HW 6.

## Assignment 1: Manhattan Building Energy Usage

The regression plotting for this assignment was done with assistance from Jordan Vani. 

For this assignment, I used NYC Energy Consumption data to explore whether we could predict the amount of energy used based on the number of units in a building. 

The analysis required two datasets to be merged, the Manhattan PLUTO shapefile and the NYC Energy and Water data file. 

After cleaning and merging the data, I fitted it with an OLS regression and a 2nd degree polynomial regression to determine which model better described the data. 

Findings: According the the Likelihood Ratio Test, the 2nd degree polynomial was a better fit for the data. 

## Assignment 2: CitiBike Rider and Membership Investigation
This investigative analysis and Authorea write-up was done collaboratively with Jordan Vani. 

For this assignment, we wanted to explore whether more 24-Hour CitiBike passes were purchased during weekends or weekdays between April - June 2016. 

We obtained data from the CitiBike System Data portal, manipulated it using Pandas, and analyzed it by performing a _t-test_.
