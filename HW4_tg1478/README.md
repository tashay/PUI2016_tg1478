## Assignment 1: Review of a classmate's Citibike project proposal

To complete this assignment, I reviewed Zhaohong Niu (zn352)'s Citibike project proposal.

I forked Zhaohong's repository that contained the Citibike proposal and completed the following tasks:

a. Verified that her Null and Alternative hypotheses were formulated correctly

b. Verified that the data supported the project: i.e. whether the data had the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values 

c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 

d. Wrote my comments, suggestions, and suggested statistical test, in a markdown named CitibikeReview_tg1478.md.

e. Submitted a pull request to the original repository.


## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests

For this assignment I worked with Francis Ko and Anastasia Shegay to find scientific journals and identify information about the statistical anaylses performed.
