A. The method does effectively assess whether sales of 24-hour passes go up on weekends. Null and alternative hypotheses are well formulated. Tashay made sure to include equal values as part of the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis suggests a relationship between the dependent and independent variables, so finding no relationship would be as invalidating as finding the opposite of the expected relationship.

B. The data was well selected and supports the hypothesis. There's no unnecessary data. Tashay did a good job aggregating the data for days of the week into an average for all Mondays, Tuesdays, etc.

C. A Chi Square test should be used, since we're comparing observed frequencies with a null assumption of similar frequencies. Are 24-hour pass sales affected by day of the week?

BONUS: A follow up question would be how much overall Citi Bike usage changes on the weekend. Would the data also show an increase in 24-hour pass purchases relative to total Citi Bike usage? A way to investigate this further would be 24-hour passes as a percentage of all trips or percentage of total bike time instead of using raw numbers of 24-hour passes bought. So in that case an alternative hypothesis could be "24-hour passes make up a higher percentage of all Citi Bike trips on weekends compared with weekdays."
