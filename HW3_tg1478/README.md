# PUI 2016 HW 3.

## Assignment 1: Write an ipython notebook that visually demonstrates in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem.

To demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem, I worked with Jordan Vani and Francis Ko to complete the following tasks: 
- GENERATE  100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 5 different distributions (500 samples in total), 
- _all with the same population mean_. Include a _Normal_, a _Poisson_, a _Binomial_, a _Chi-Squared_, and a _Log_Normal distribution.    
- Each sample includes plot of the sample mean (dependent var.) against the sample size N (independent var.)  
- Each figure includes a description of the behavior in the plots in terms of the law of large numbers.
- Each sample mean distribution is plotted.

## Assignment 2: Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data.

To explore the CitiBike rider and membership data, I worked with Jordan Vani and Francis Ko to complete the following tasks:
- State a research question to answer, formulate the Null and Alternative hypothesis and confidence level.
- Use pandas to read in the CitiBike files
- Display the top few rows of the dataframe. The table is rendered. 
- Display the reducted dataframe. The table is rendered.
- Plot the data distributions.

## Assignment 3: Finish z-test lab and turn it in as a notebook 
This is an investigation of a hypothetical new bus route and whether it improves travel times.
- Statement of Null and Alternative hypothesis and confidence level. 
- Calculate the Z value in order to accept or reject Null hypothesis.
